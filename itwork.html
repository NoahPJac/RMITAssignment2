                    <br>
                    <p>For our IT Work competent we elected to interview a Jack Chang a software developer based down in Coffs Harbour. Jack has worked on several fantastic projects such an example is the online Naplan test, where he worked as part of a team to create the online components. Jack has really provided us with some fantastic insight into the world of IT development.</p>
                    <p>We have created a summary overview of our interview with him as well as compiled a list of the top questions and answers that we posed to him. Finally, we have created a detailed explanation of this new information relates to the group and our possible future careers.</p>
                    <p><em>** Jack requested no webs cameras before we started the interview **</em></p>

                    <h5><u><strong>Interview Question & Answers, Key Questions</strong></u></h5>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p><strong>What aspects of IT do you work in?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>I'm a software developer, a software developer mostly working like C++, a little bit of HTML, JavaScript, that kind of thing but mostly back end stuff with C sharp. </em></p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Can you break down what your role has been within these projects?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>Sure, so predominantly I work on a team of like 5 or 6 people and we generally get work assigned to us from the larger planning committee. So there will be stuff like we need you to implement a way for student result data to get exported and you know well as a team works out. The best way to do that. And I'll generally be responsible for coding all the back-end parts of it. So a key example of that would be, when we were exporting student data, I wrote a background process that gathered the data and then exported it to a third-party system.</em></p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Can you explain your team composition and your role within the team?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>So I work on a larger software development team, so on the team with me, five other developers split between front end and back end. There's a tech lead in a scrum master. He kind of takes care of the day-to-day admin stuff. And then there's someone from the product team on there. Take care of things like making sure we're designing things that look correct, making sure we will have our requirements correct. Make sure they're creating the right stuff, and then we have testers that make sure that it's all working properly.</em></p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Can you break down how a project goes from concept to finished state?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>In simplest terms, we get a contract one way or another. Then we figure out what our product is missing to meet their needs, which then broken up into different epics (groups of work) then those are broken up into stories (specific singular pieces of work) those are then refined by a team of developers to add the specifics on how to add those to the product. We then take the refined stories into each sprint (2-week gap of work) until we feel like we have as much work as we can fully complete (i.e. shippable) in that sprint, we then repeat that process until we have sprints planned until the work is done (this process is repeated while in motion, so we might plan the 2nd sprint halfway through the first, then the 3rd halfway through the second, etc).
                            So as an example for RMS we might need: to meet their needs tests and give them answers. This means we need the epics: Add video questions, mark answers upon completion of the answer (not at the end of the test), and export answers For the video questions epic we'd have stories like Add a new way to create video questions Show video questions to the user Mark video questions automatically Add video question responses to our reports</em></p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Has there been any challenges that you have faced both technical and whilst working within a team on ICT projects?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>one of the more recent product problems we have is we had a lot of. Separate code branches, so essentially the same kind of product, but split across a couple of different versions and what we've been trying to focus on quite recently is trying to get back to one singular version, and it's in cases like this where the Sprint and agile method kind of fall apart a little bit because you know, there's not a discrete piece of work that needs to be done in this case of like you know, keep putting stuff back into the one branch, keep fixing the bugs that come out of putting that into one branch, so I guess a technical challenge for us recently has been trying to consolidate all this code. All these different branches back into one singular code branch and quick like a lot of technical challenges to come up with that, as well as a lot of process challenges have come up.</em></p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>So what about team-based challenges?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>Again, like a lot of those process challenges are being team-based, so you know. Yeah, but as I mentioned earlier, we've got like a product person and them kind of don't know what to do. They just like. Keep working at what you're doing and you know it's really hard to plan what we're doing for two weeks when a lot of that planning is just fixed a bug and fixing the bug could take two weeks. Could take 2 minutes, so it's very hard to focus on a lot of those planning-based aspects.</em></p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>What did you study in High School & University to acquire the skills required for your current role?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>in high school didn't do anything. I was talking with some of the other days, but I did. Is it mainly graphics design, architecture, that kind of thing? So nothing relevant there. In High School or some * like that is but yeah, yeah, exactly. You know as a kid I was always programming things in her was creating custom Maps in Warcraft 3 using the coding engine and that was great. That was more coffee on my **** memory Lane. Yeah, right. So yeah, it was very like I always. I was always in programming as a kid's fault. I didn't get into the industry in terms of tertiary education. I got a diploma in Programming from SAE which is in the student Sydney. Uhm? And then I took that and went to do a game design game development course to get a degree in that side. Mostly did games programming. I kind of thing and then to get into the industry. Started as a tester. Did software testing for about six months and then a junior development position opened up and was like hey my new C Sharp. I've proven myself to be a good employee. Could I have that job and they just gave it to me without even an interview? And I've been working as a developer ever since, which is about four years now.</em></p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Looking at your previous personal and university experience, how beneficial was a university in comparison to self-teaching?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>Sort of with self-learning, yeah. Found it very useful. You know, I think something that people say a lot is if you'd learn by yourself what you're likely to do is just reinforce your own mistakes, and I think a big part of what tertiary education offered me was the ability to essentially do my projects. 'cause I was doing game design and development, so I was doing a lot of creating prototype games, that kind of thing, and then I would take that project that I made and took it to the tutor or the teacher, the lecture or whatever, and they said to me, hey, this is good work, but here are the mistakes you made and it's things like that that I found the most valuable in. University because it allowed me to correct my mistakes, whereas I think if I was going up by myself, I just keep making those dumb mistakes over and over again. </em></p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>What advice do you have for students wanting to get into a similar role in the IT industry?</strong></p>
                        <p><em>Probably build a portfolio of some kind, like show that you can and will apply your knowledge in some interesting way</em></p></li>
